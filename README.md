# Bash scripts

Scripts published here are created in order to help users in configuring their GNU/Linux distros after installation. They're all tested with shellcheck, although I recommend using them by more advanced users.

## Supported distros (so far)
* Ubuntu
* Debian
* Fedora
* openSUSE

## Scripts' descriptions
* *appssetup.sh* - this script lets user install some proprietary apps without having to search for them on different websites and manually download packages

## Plans for the future
* GUI (Zenity/KDialog)
* POSIX-compatibility

## Feedback
Feel free to leave any opinions about these scripts - it'll help me improve them and I'll be glad to hear from you :)
